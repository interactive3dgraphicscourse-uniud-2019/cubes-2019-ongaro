After reading the assignment i' ve decided to represent the front face of a medieval castle, and using as an animation the lifting bridge as a minimum; more could be added later on.
I' ll now try to get familiar with the starting code and box creation/placement methods.
After realizing the front face alone could be a bit too simple, i' m considering designing an entire (but not too massive) fort. An animation i' m also considering is partolling guards, represented simply of course.

Made paper sketches of the castle' s front view and top view.
I' ll now start positioning boxes to form the front face
I realized that the structure is symmetrical, so i' m considering positioning half the structure at a time with a function.
Half of the wall structure is done, no problems so far. Switching to corner towers and merlons now
Merlon placing is taking up quite a lot of code lines, so i' ll definitely think of a more efficient way to place them with some functions.
The function for placing tower merlons is done and working. Gonna work on a function that makes a cluster of 6 merlons to rotate/traslate where needed
